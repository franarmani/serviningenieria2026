      "descripcion": "The Velan pressure seal flexible wedge gate valve was pioneered by Velan in 1960. It has a large flexibility index up to 0.035” (0.89 mm) within normal closing torques and allowable stresses to compensate for seat distortions caused by piping loads, thermal and pressure fluctuations, seal-welding of seats and cooling down of a valve closed hot. It is the ideal choice for critical power plant applications where valves are subject to frequent start-ups and shut-downs.",
