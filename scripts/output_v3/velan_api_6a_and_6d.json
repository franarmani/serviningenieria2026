Velan’s DTP series are the optimal solution for controlling high levels of fluid pressure in the most difficult conditions such as dirty and corrosive fluid services. Angle choke are traditional robust angle valves with a multistage trim and a corresponding plug specifically designed to provide high energy dissipation. The valve’s multi-stage technology and discrete tortuous path design divides the flow into many streams reducing pressure and fluid velocity avoiding cavitation, flashing or erosion phenomena. Velan ABV offers the advantage of intechangeable plug and trim components, the valve has no welded internal parts, resulting low maintenance costs. Actuation can be either hydraulic or pneumatic depending on the speed requested. Stepper actuators are an option for reaching the highest level of accuracy.

Fast and prompt closing is assured due to the powerful spring and short valve stroke. As forward velocity begins to slow, the spring assist starts to close the disc. By the time it reaches zero, the valve disc is closed against the seat before reverse flow can occur, preventing a peak of pressure in the line and water hammer phenomena. In addition, Velan ABV offers a compact version of No-slam check valves, providing the same reliability and quality of the traditional No-slam valves, but with significant space and weight savings.

The swinging action of the disc away from the seat allows forward flow and when the flow is stopped, the disc returns to the seat, preventing backflow. Swing check valves are suitable for installations in lines where pigging operations are required for various maintenance services. The piggable design makes the swing check valve ideal for installation in riser pipelines and subsea applications. Convenience of operation and simple in-line maintenance are essential features of our design. Internal parts can be inspected and repaired without removing the valve off the pipeline even where space is restricted as in the top entry trunnion ball valve construction.The valve can be installed in both vertical and horizontal positions and offers unsurpassed quality and reliability– while the simple design minimizes maintenance costs.

Our design provides a competitive solution in an ever-expanding market that faces technical and economic challenges. We offer a wide range of two or three-piece forged bolted body trunnion mounted ball valves. Two independent seats provide easy bidirectional sealing to ensure the greatest level of tightness and reliability under high pressure and temperature conditions in critical isolation services. High pressure compact ball valves have the same reliability and level of quality as traditional API valves but with significant space and weight savings due to the compact flange design integrated into the valve closures. Compact welding neck flanges that connect the pipeline to the valve provide further space savings. Design and selection of materials are fully customizable to meet the customer’s project specifications. Seat design Features Operator Testing & certifications",

Side-entry floating ball valves are manufactured in accordance with API 6D and BS EN ISO 17292 standards. The valve is configured in a forged bolted two-piece split-body design with a small diameter, suitable for medium/lor pressure working conditions.Characterized by simple design, the valve seats are directly inserted into the body. The upstream flow pressure pushes the free-floating ball against the downstream seat-the resulting compression provides a perfect leak-free sealing solution even after years in-service. The stem is connected at the top of the ball and allowing the valve to open and close with a quarter-turn movement. Material selection is fully customizable to meet the customer’s project specifications and several unique features are available offering an enhanced technical solution suitable for aggressive offshore environment and corrosive and abrasive fluids.
