      "descripcion": "Velan’s Torqseal® 2.0 triple offset valve is engineered to deliver repeatable full bi-directional zero leakage, lower torques and superior fugitive emissions performance. Offering a bi-directional zero leakage closure with a metal-to-metal seat, the Torqseal® triple offset valve is the right solution when a tight seal is required. The Torqseal’s all metal construction results in an inherently fire-safe design that can stand up to the most demanding services.",

        "The Torqseal® advanced design features a triple eccentricity and unique elliptical seat geometry, that allows for friction free, non-rubbing operation of the valve during all of the valve travel.",
        "Zero leakage seat tightness (API 598 resilient seat standard). The resilient metal seal ring radially compresses around it’s circumference when torque is evenly applied as the seal ring makes contact with the integral metal body seat.",
        "The robust centered-weighted splined connection between disc/shaft produces a uniform and repeatable torque transmissionand ensures even distribution of contact pressure between seat and seal.",
        "Torqseal® valves are dual qualified for API 641 and ISO-15848-1 fugitive emission requirements.",
        "Torqseal® valves are fire safe qualified."
